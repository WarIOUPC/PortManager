## The Game

This game is a small god game where the player will need to properly manage a fishing port in order to collect a certain amount of money. But the boats can break, and the port workers will need to collect their salary, otherwise the player will lose. Find the balance between selling materials in order to upgrade the port and keep some for the workers.

### Controls

Use WASD to move the camera around. Each time a forklift delivers materials from a dock to the delivery point, the player will obtain them. Materials are used to pay the workers and repair boats, and can be exchanged for money. Money is used for buying more ships, workers and forklifts. During night, all the boats will return to the port. But if the player activates the lighthouse, which consumes money periodically, the boats will keep fishing during night.
